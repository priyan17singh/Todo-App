# ✅ myTask - React Todo App

The **myTask** app is a modern and minimalistic **Todo Manager** built using **React** and **Tailwind CSS**. It allows users to efficiently manage their daily tasks with features like add, edit, delete, and mark as completed — all while saving data in **Local Storage** for persistence.
